# Spam Classifier Project

For this project, we aim to predict text messages as "spam" or "not spam" using three different machine learning models. The dataset used is from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mohitgupta-omg/Kaggle-SMS-Spam-Collection-Dataset-/blob/master/spam.csv). we use linear regression, logistic regression, and naive Bayes to train, test, and validate the performance of each model on the dataset. This is done using the scikit-learn library.

**Note:** Please refer to the full report in the [docs folder](/docs) for more detailed analysis and interpretation.

## Code Sample
You can find the Python code used for this mini project in the [src folder](/src).

## How to Use
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
- Run the Python scripts in the src folder to train and test the models.
